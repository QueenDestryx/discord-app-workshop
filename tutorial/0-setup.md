# Step 0: Project setup

Before we dive in, we'll need to set up our actual project. If you prefer developing locally, you're more than welcome to do so but to make setup a bit easier, I recommend using an online IDE like [Glitch](https://glitch.com) or [Replit](https://replit.com). Both of these give you a public environment where you can develop and run your app.

> ðŸ’¡ That "public" part of public environment is important because Discord needs a public URL where it can send interactive events that are relevant to your app (like when a user invokes your app's slash command). If you're developing locally, you'll need to tunnel requests using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
